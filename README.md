# ggtheme
ggplot2 themes for presentation (poster + beamer)

I should probably rename this repo differently. ggtheme is already a package: https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes.

And I should definitely turn it into an R package.

### Usage

How to use it:

```
devtools::source_url("https://raw.github.com/sinarueeger/ggtheme/master/theme_presentation.R")
```
